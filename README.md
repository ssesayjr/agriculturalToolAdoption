# Learning and Adoption of Agricultural Techniques and Technologies Introduced by Non-Govrenment Organizations
In early 1961 John F. Kennedy founded an organization geared towards humanitarium work, and the increased assistance of individuals in less than forgiving environments/conditions. With the motto "From the American People", USAID was founded and positioned to help developing countries globally. The work tasked by USAID, via the State Department, was in various fields that included Agriculture, Education, Trafficking, Health, etc. Various Non-Government Organization were founded to help address the level of committment needed. However with the evolution of technology, accessbility, and data aggregation, the efficacy of some NGO intervention needed to be supported quantitatively.

This capstone will try to address a very specific agricultural intervention of one NGO in Guinea West Africa by using supervised data, that spans 5 different cities, collected from 2016 until 2019, +1500 participant dissagregates. This data set includes information based on program participants adoption of a newly introduced agricultural tool/technique by said NGO. The question this capstone attempts to address:

What are the contributing variables that influence project participants to apply/utilize a agricultural tool or technique introduced by an NGO?
